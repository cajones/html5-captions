1
00:00:05,000 --&gt; 00:00:07,440
In most countries 
on the continent

2
00:00:08,000 --&gt; 00:00:12,720
There were princes,
they were absolute regimes,

3
00:00:13,160 --&gt; 00:00:16,480
The degree of absolutism was 
relative to a particular setting,

4
00:00:17,000 --&gt; 00:00:21,480
But If you take France as the most important
central, most populace country, 

5
00:00:22,000 --&gt; 00:00:27,320
you had a very elaborate system of 
censorship, but in addition to that,

6
00:00:27,680 --&gt; 00:00:32,160
you had a monopoly of production 
in the bookseller's guild in Paris,

7
00:00:32,560 --&gt; 00:00:34,040
it had police powers

8
00:00:34,240 --&gt; 00:00:38,040
and then the police itself had 
specialised inspectors of the book trade

9
00:00:38,520 --&gt; 00:00:40,080
so you put all of that together 

10
00:00:40,440 --&gt; 00:00:44,760
and the state was very powerful 
in its attempt to control the printed word.

11
00:00:45,200 --&gt; 00:00:48,040
By the time you time you get 
to the age of the Enlightenment 

12
00:00:48,200 --&gt; 00:00:53,320
there's a highly organised 
administration of the book trade,

13
00:00:53,680 --&gt; 00:00:58,320
so in principle anything that appears in print 
has to pass the censorship 

14
00:00:58,680 --&gt; 00:01:00,720
and be registered,

15
00:01:01,120 --&gt; 00:01:03,320
to go through an elaborate process,

16
00:01:03,800 --&gt; 00:01:05,920
and of course this didn't work

17
00:01:06,600 --&gt; 00:01:09,160
that the directions set,

18
00:01:10,000 --&gt; 00:01:15,600
the organisation set up 
by the state was so elaborate, 

19
00:01:16,000 --&gt; 00:01:18,040
so baroque in its bureaucracy

20
00:01:18,440 --&gt; 00:01:20,680
that in a sense it was 
counterproductive.

21
00:01:21,680 --&gt; 00:01:23,080
 Censorship, you know,

22
00:01:23,880 --&gt; 00:01:25,280
varies from regime to regime.

23
00:01:26,200 --&gt; 00:01:27,040
We think we know 
what censorship is,

24
00:01:27,960 --&gt; 00:01:33,200
but i would argue that it's a 
different thing under different systems,

25
00:01:34,000 --&gt; 00:01:37,560
so the basic idea of censorship 
in 18th century france

26
00:01:38,360 --&gt; 00:01:40,000
is the concept of privilege 
or private law,

27
00:01:40,960 --&gt; 00:01:44,000
a publisher gets the right to publish 
a particular text 

28
00:01:44,000 --&gt; 00:01:45,840
that is denied to others,

29
00:01:46,160 --&gt; 00:01:47,760
so he has that privilege.

30
00:01:48,000 --&gt; 00:01:51,560
that's different from censorship 
under stalin, say, or hitler

31
00:01:52,520 --&gt; 00:01:59,560
 There is a monopoly of what's called 
the booksellers guild of paris.

32
00:02:00,000 --&gt; 00:02:02,200
it has police power;

33
00:02:02,680 --&gt; 00:02:08,840
its syndics and aguane are 
obliged to inspect

34
00:02:09,800 --&gt; 00:02:11,360
all of the printing houses in paris

35
00:02:12,000 --&gt; 00:02:16,320
and printers are officially limited 
to 36 printing shops.

36
00:02:17,000 --&gt; 00:02:19,760
And so the guild is supposed to go 
around from shop to shop

37
00:02:20,000 --&gt; 00:02:22,000
and find out what 
they're printing,

38
00:02:22,680 --&gt; 00:02:24,560
make sure there are no illegal 
books being printed.

39
00:02:25,520 --&gt; 00:02:28,560
No books that 
contravene privileges

40
00:02:29,280 --&gt; 00:02:34,040
the equivalent of copyright in a sense etc.
So yes they have powers 

41
00:02:35,000 --&gt; 00:02:37,920
and they also inspect every single book 
which is shipped into paris.

42
00:02:38,120 --&gt; 00:02:41,080
the books are stopped at the wall 
which surrounds paris

43
00:02:42,000 --&gt; 00:02:45,560
and any ship which is 
marked 'libri' books

44
00:02:46,440 --&gt; 00:02:50,080
is sent to a special 
large hall

45
00:02:51,000 --&gt; 00:02:54,440
where the  booksellers guild and inspector 
of police will inspect it.

46
00:02:54,760 --&gt; 00:02:57,000
Essentially what you have

47
00:02:57,680 --&gt; 00:03:01,280
is a centralised administration for 
controlling the book trade

48
00:03:02,000 --&gt; 00:03:05,120
using censorship and 
also using the monopoly

49
00:03:06,000 --&gt; 00:03:07,680
of the established publishers

50
00:03:08,000 --&gt; 00:03:10,280
against that you've got 
publishing houses,

51
00:03:11,000 --&gt; 00:03:13,040
print presses that 
surround france

52
00:03:14,000 --&gt; 00:03:16,000
in what i call a 
'fertile crescent'

53
00:03:16,720 --&gt; 00:03:19,040
dozens and dozens of them producing 
books which are smuggled

54
00:03:20,000 --&gt; 00:03:21,040
across the french borders

55
00:03:22,000 --&gt; 00:03:25,040
 and distributed everywhere in the kingdom 
by an underground system,

56
00:03:25,920 --&gt; 00:03:29,920
so in effect you've got two systems 
at war with one another.

57
00:03:30,560 --&gt; 00:03:33,200
And it's the system of production 
outside france

58
00:03:34,040 --&gt; 00:03:36,440
that is crucial for the 
enlightenment,

59
00:03:37,040 --&gt; 00:03:40,320
virtually all of the works that we associate 
with the french enlightenment

60
00:03:41,040 --&gt; 00:03:43,840
are published in Amsterdam, 
in the Hague,

61
00:03:44,280 --&gt; 00:03:47,600
in Brussels in Geneva, 
in Neuchatel, in Basel 

62
00:03:48,560 --&gt; 00:03:50,920
these are the places where 
Rosseau, Voltaire 

63
00:03:51,400 --&gt; 00:03:53,800
and company get 
themselves printed,

64
00:03:54,480 --&gt; 00:03:57,000
but these printers also 
produce other things

65
00:03:57,960 --&gt; 00:04:00,840
because they're in it not simply 
to spread enlightenment,

66
00:04:01,720 --&gt; 00:04:04,360
many of them are sympathetic 
to the enlightenment

67
00:04:05,000 --&gt; 00:04:08,400
they're in it to make money. So 
they will satisfy demand,

68
00:04:09,000 --&gt; 00:04:10,760
whatever the demand might be...

69
00:04:11,240 --&gt; 00:04:13,200
the pirates had agents in paris

70
00:04:14,000 --&gt; 00:04:16,840
and everywhere else, who were sending 
them sheets of new books

71
00:04:17,400 --&gt; 00:04:18,680
which they think will sell well,

72
00:04:19,320 --&gt; 00:04:24,400
 the pirates are systematically 
doing market research

73
00:04:25,480 --&gt; 00:04:32,560
in hundreds and thousands of letters, 
they are sounding the market,

74
00:04:33,160 --&gt; 00:04:34,840
they want to know 
what demand is

75
00:04:35,520 --&gt; 00:04:40,880
the reaction of publishers at the centre 
is of course extremely hostile,

76
00:04:41,760 --&gt; 00:04:43,000
I've read a lot of their letters;

77
00:04:43,480 --&gt; 00:04:45,320
they're full of expressions 
like buccaneer

78
00:04:46,240 --&gt; 00:04:50,800
and private and people without 
shame or morality etc.

79
00:04:51,920 --&gt; 00:04:55,720
in actual fact many of these pirates 
were good bourgeois,

80
00:04:56,320 --&gt; 00:04:58,920
in Lausanne or, Geneva 
or, Amsterdam

81
00:04:59,560 --&gt; 00:05:02,560
and they thought, that they were 
just 'doing business'.

82
00:05:03,200 --&gt; 00:05:06,280
after all there was no 
international copyright law

83
00:05:07,120 --&gt; 00:05:10,240
and they were satisfying demand. 
If the demand hapend to be in france 

84
00:05:11,000 --&gt; 00:05:12,960
well, that's a problem 
for the french,

85
00:05:13,560 --&gt; 00:05:15,200
 but not for the 
dutch or the swiss

86
00:05:15,840 --&gt; 00:05:17,760
I must admit, 
I always hesitate

87
00:05:18,360 --&gt; 00:05:20,520
to pronounce on 
world historical trends.

88
00:05:21,480 --&gt; 00:05:24,400
But i've spend a lot 
of time in the archives

89
00:05:25,360 --&gt; 00:05:27,840
and you can at least 
glimpse something,

90
00:05:28,200 --&gt; 00:05:30,920
 that might look world 
historical from time to time,

91
00:05:31,360 --&gt; 00:05:33,400
as you go through 
various bits of old paper.

92
00:05:34,480 --&gt; 00:05:37,680
What is clear is that 
during the 18th century

93
00:05:38,640 --&gt; 00:05:42,800
 that the printed word as a 
force is expanding everywhere

94
00:05:43,760 --&gt; 00:05:45,960
and we can go into a 
lots of detailed studies

95
00:05:46,680 --&gt; 00:05:48,840
to find out why an 
how that this happened

96
00:05:49,800 --&gt; 00:05:53,760
The population is increasing, the 
educational institutions are spreading,

97
00:05:54,360 --&gt; 00:05:59,040
literacy is going up and there is this 
new thing we call 'public opinion'.

98
00:06:00,000 --&gt; 00:06:02,840
The phrase itself is first used in 
the middle of the 18th century,

99
00:06:03,720 --&gt; 00:06:05,760
I think the phenomenon 
existed earlier,

100
00:06:06,560 --&gt; 00:06:08,600
but for the last half 
of the 18th century

101
00:06:09,240 --&gt; 00:06:13,240
there is a public that is 
fascinated with public affairs,

102
00:06:14,200 --&gt; 00:06:17,840
now the mechanism 
for controlling the media

103
00:06:18,600 --&gt; 00:06:20,840
if you want to use that expression 
notably the print media

104
00:06:21,800 --&gt; 00:06:25,000
is simply not adequate to 
controlling this demand.

105
00:06:25,960 --&gt; 00:06:29,480
So everywhere around france, 
even within france,

106
00:06:30,440 --&gt; 00:06:35,720
there are entrepreneurs who take it 
upon themselves to satisfy this demand 

107
00:06:36,560 --&gt; 00:06:39,400
and this can be in the form of clandestine manuscript newsletters,

108
00:06:40,360 --&gt; 00:06:45,080
it can be in a form of fully printed 
books and there are many other forms

109
00:06:46,040 --&gt; 00:06:49,120
the one that I find most 
interesting is songs.

110
00:06:49,840 --&gt; 00:06:54,840
It turns out that everyone in the 
18th century, if you take paris,

111
00:06:55,680 --&gt; 00:06:59,760
had a repertory of tunes in his 
or her had, as we do today.

112
00:07:00,680 --&gt; 00:07:02,840
most of my tunes come 
from commercials actually

113
00:07:03,800 --&gt; 00:07:05,720
People would improvise 

114
00:07:06,680 --&gt; 00:07:09,640
new words to old tunes, 
everyday.

115
00:07:10,600 --&gt; 00:07:13,800
And these would be sung 
in the streets of paris,

116
00:07:14,680 --&gt; 00:07:17,640
sometimes by professionals, 
who had hurdy-gurdys

117
00:07:18,600 --&gt; 00:07:23,760
and would simply belt out the last 
verse tune that everyone knew.

118
00:07:24,720 --&gt; 00:07:26,320
And it could be about 
the kings mistress,

119
00:07:27,000 --&gt; 00:07:29,120
 it could be about a minister 
who is abusing power,

120
00:07:30,120 --&gt; 00:07:33,600
it could be on a whole variety 
of quite political subjects.

121
00:07:34,560 --&gt; 00:07:38,760
This new verse is then picked up 
because it is a great mnemonic device

122
00:07:39,720 --&gt; 00:07:42,880
and the song is been song throughout 
the streets of paris.

123
00:07:43,600 --&gt; 00:07:47,920
I imagine the street of paris - it is just 
echoing everywhere with songs.

124
00:07:48,880 --&gt; 00:07:53,480
So that is a good example of how 
in the absence of news media

125
00:07:54,440 --&gt; 00:08:00,600
of proper newspaper, a new 
kind of medium developed,

126
00:08:01,280 --&gt; 00:08:03,240
that actually does 
the job of newspapers

127
00:08:04,200 --&gt; 00:08:09,280
 I've studied hundreds of these songs and I would say, they were sung newspapers.

128
00:08:10,240 --&gt; 00:08:14,520
There's  no way that an 
absolutist political system

129
00:08:15,200 --&gt; 00:08:17,040
can totally suppress the 
spread of information

130
00:08:18,000 --&gt; 00:08:21,040
new media adapt themselves 
to these circumstances,

131
00:08:22,000 --&gt; 00:08:26,240
and often they can become even more 
effective because of the repression.

132
00:08:27,200 --&gt; 00:08:30,680
It's a fascinating process 
and it culminates frankly 

133
00:08:31,560 --&gt; 00:08:34,400
right on the eve of the france 
revolution, so that i would argue,

134
00:08:35,000 --&gt; 00:08:38,040
Not only did this new media system 
spread the enlightenment

135
00:08:39,000 --&gt; 00:08:41,920
but, I won't use the word 
'prepared', the way for the revolution

136
00:08:42,880 --&gt; 00:08:46,280
it indicted the old regim

137
00:08:47,120 --&gt; 00:08:50,560
that this power, public opinion, 
became crucial

138
00:08:51,520 --&gt; 00:08:55,560
in the collapse of 
the government 1787-1788.
